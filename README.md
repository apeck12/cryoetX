# cryoetX
A data processing pipeline for solving structures from tomograms of protein nanocrystals. Code is also included to simulate such data and model the effects of radiation damage in either real or reciprocal space. Scripts require a LIBTBX/CCTBX python distribution and leverage crystallography algorithms from that software as indicated. Code was written for Python 2.7.
